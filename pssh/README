####run this script from local server only####

PSSH is a command utility for sending one command to multiple servers. The PSSH package is needed for this script to work.

Copy the pssh directory from the scripts directory to your ~/ directory of choice before using. 

pssh_passwd.py will prompt for a password for a one time command execution. This script pulls frm the hostnames file for machines(ip addresses) and logs stderr to the log directory for individual nodes. If you want a complete logging of everything to both the terminal & the logfile file just hit the [y] at the prompt.

This script pull from the hostname file for machines(FQDN) andlogs stderr to the log directory for individual nodes. If you want complete logging of everthing to both terminal & the logfile file just hit the [y] at the prompt.
