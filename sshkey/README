****Please only run these scripts from pet-itjumpbox****

Copy the sshkey directory from the scripts directory to your ~/ of choice before using.

There are two scripts ping_sweep.py & sshkey_host.py to accomplish two different jobs. Pingsweep uses the fping package to scan a network segment logging any IP that "is alive" to the file ip_scan. From there each IP goes through a DNS reverse lookup for the hostname which is logged to the hostnames file.

Sshkey_host.py(You need to generate a ssh-key pair for this to work) works off of the hostnames file using either root or NIS account and copying your SSH public key to the desired servers for sshkey authentication. For each successfull public key that is copied, the hostname will be written to the success_host file.

Pingsweep.py requires the fping rpm/deb packaged to be installed for it to work.

Sshkey_host.py requires the Python-paramiko package to be installed for it to work.
